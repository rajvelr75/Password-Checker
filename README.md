# This Python project lets you check if a password has been compromised in data breaches. It uses the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API to securely query a massive database of leaked password hashes. Simply install the `requests` library with `pip install requests`, then run the script with `python main.py <your_password>`. Remember, never commit your actual password to version control! The script will tell you if your password has been leaked and how many times it's been found. This is a reminder to use strong, unique passwords and change them regularly. While the script uses SHA-1 hashing (be aware of its limitations), consider using a more secure algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 for password storage.
